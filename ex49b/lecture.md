A Statistics Server:

Solution

The Plan
====

I'll show you how I implemented the protocol in the smallest code possible.

I won't implement all of the CRUD operations, so you can go look at the 
git repo for this project to see a full implementation.



The Setup
====

First I setup the data, then the protocol parser, then the handlers.



The Final Code
====

The last thing I would do is add better tests and round out the protocol with CRUD operations.
