Exercise 8
----

If, Else-If, Else



The Plan
====

Simply learn to use this:

    if(TEST) {
        CODE;
    } else if(TEST) {
        CODE;
    } else {
        CODE;
    }

The Analysis

Breaking It
====

* It kind of just works, but remove the *else* and change the logic.

End Of Lecture 8
=====

* You were briefly introduced to *&&*, which does an *and* comparison,
  so go research online the different *Boolean operators*.
* Write a few more test cases for this program to see what you can come
  up with.
* Go back to Exercises 10 and 11, and use *if-statements* to make
  the loops exit early.  You'll need the *break* statement to do that.
  Go read about it.
* Is the first test really saying the right thing?  To you, the *first argument*
  isn't the same first argument a user entered.  Fix it.
