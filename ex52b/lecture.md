Exercise 52
----

Hacking and Improving Your Server

Solution
----



The Plan
====

Hack the server with a few simple scripts to demonstrate problems.

Show you my improvements to the server to solve the problems I discussed.



The Purpose
====

Teach you that you *never* assume your code is good. 

You're a scientist not a god. 

Always assume there's a chance you're wrong.



Hacking Demo
====

This is an ultra light hacking demo.

It could get much worse if I had more time.



Fixing These Flaws
====

Now I'll fix a few of these flaws to show you how it's done, and leave the
rest to you.

Look at the github repository to see all of the things I fixed.
